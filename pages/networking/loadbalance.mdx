# Elastic Load Balancing

# Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

## Definition

Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is an AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more availability zones. ELB serves to enhance the availability and fault tolerance of applications.

## Overview

ELB performs the following key functions:

1. **Distribution of Traffic:** ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic among multiple targets to ensure no single point of failure, thereby improving the availability and fault tolerance of applications.

2. **Scaling:** ELB can scale automatically based on incoming traffic, thus adapting to varying loads. It ensures that each target receives an even distribution of requests.

3. **Health Checks:** ELB continually monitors the health of registered targets and directs traffic only to healthy instances. If an instance becomes unhealthy, ELB stops sending traffic to it until it is restored.

4. **Availability Zones:** ELB can be configured to distribute traffic evenly across multiple availability zones to enhance fault tolerance.

5. **Security:** ELB supports SSL/TLS termination, allowing it to handle secure connections and offload the work of encrypting and decrypting data from the application instances.

## Key Components

ELB consists of the following key components:

1. **Load Balancer:** The main ELB entity responsible for distributing incoming traffic across multiple targets. There are different types of load balancers, including Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer.

2. **Target:** A registered instance, IP address, or container that receives traffic from the load balancer.

3. **Listener:** A process that checks for connection requests and uses the protocol and port to check the request.

4. **Availability Zone:** A distinct location within a region, composed of one or more discrete data centers.

## Steps to Set Up Elastic Load Balancing

1. **Create a Load Balancer:** Use the AWS Management Console or command-line interface to create a load balancer, specifying details such as the type (ALB, NLB, or Classic), listeners, and availability zones.

2. **Configure Health Checks:** Set up health checks to monitor the health of registered targets. ELB will route traffic only to healthy targets.

3. **Add Targets:** Register EC2 instances or other resources as targets with the load balancer.

4. **Configure Security Groups:** Adjust security group settings to control the traffic to and from the load balancer.

5. **Update DNS:** After the load balancer is created, update the DNS records to point to the load balancer's DNS name.

## Example: Load Balancing Web Traffic

### Problem
An e-commerce website experiences varying levels of traffic throughout the day, and the web servers need to scale dynamically to handle increased demand while maintaining fault tolerance.

### Solution using Elastic Load Balancing
1. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the desired AWS region.
2. Configure the ALB with listeners for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
3. Add EC2 instances as targets to the ALB to distribute incoming web traffic.
4. Set up health checks to monitor the health of the EC2 instances.
5. Update DNS records to point to the ALB's DNS name.
6. ELB dynamically scales the number of instances based on traffic, ensuring availability and fault tolerance.

This solution ensures that the e-commerce website remains responsive and available, handling traffic fluctuations effectively.
